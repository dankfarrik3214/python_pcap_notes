# System Information Collector

## Overview

The **System Information Collector** is a Python script that gathers and displays detailed information about the system on which the script is executed. It leverages the `platform` module to retrieve various system attributes, including the platform, machine type, processor information, operating system name and version, as well as the Python implementation and version.

## Objective

This script is designed as a code challenge to help reinforce the understanding of the `platform` module functions, which are part of the Python PCAP exam syllabus.

## Method

There should be a function called collect_system_info() that returns the expected output


## Expected Output

The script will print the system information in a formatted manner. Example output:
