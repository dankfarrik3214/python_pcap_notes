# Python Module Challenge: Understanding `__pycache__`

## Overview

This coding challenge is designed to help you understand the purpose and behavior of the `__pycache__` directory in Python. You will create a Python module and explore how Python handles compiled bytecode by observing the `__pycache__` directory.

## Challenge Steps

### Step 1: Create a Python Module
1. Create a file called **`my_module.py`** in your working directory.
2. In **`my_module.py`**, define a function called `greet()` that prints the message:

   ```python
   print("Hello from my_module!")
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Main Script
1. Create another file called **`main.py`** in the same directory.
2. In **`main.py`**, import the `my_module` module.
3. Call the `greet()` function from `my_module`.

### Step 3: Run the Script
1. Run the **`main.py`** script using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Check the directory structure after running the script. Look for a folder named `__pycache__`.

### Step 4: Analyze the `__pycache__`
- Where is the `__pycache__` directory created?
- What is the purpose of the `__pycache__` directory in this context?

### Bonus Task
1. Modify the **`my_module.py`** file (e.g., change the message in `greet()`).
2. Run **`main.py`** again.
3. Observe the changes in the `__pycache__` directory and explain why they happen.
