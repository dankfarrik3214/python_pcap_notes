# Python Coding Challenge: Searching for and Through Modules and Packages

## Overview

In this challenge, you'll explore how Python searches for modules and packages when importing them. You will learn how Python uses the `sys.path` to locate modules and experiment with searching through packages.

## Challenge Steps

### Step 1: Create a Python Package
1. Create a folder called **`my_search_package`** in your working directory.
2. Inside **`my_search_package`**, create an empty file called **`__init__.py`**.
3. In the **`my_search_package`** folder, create two new files:
   - **`module1.py`**: Contains a function `greet()` that prints "Hello from module1!"
   - **`module2.py`**: Contains a function `greet()` that prints "Hello from module2!"

### Step 2: Create a Main Script
1. In the parent directory (outside `my_search_package`), create a file called **`main.py`**.
2. In **`main.py`**, do the following:
   - Import both `module1` and `module2` from `my_search_package`.
   - Call the `greet()` function from both modules.

### Step 3: Modify the Search Path
1. In **`main.py`**, import the `sys` module.
2. Print the `sys.path` to see the list of directories Python searches through to find modules and packages.
   ```python
   import sys
   print(sys.path)
   ```
3. Add a new directory to the `sys.path` using the `append()` method:
   ```python
   sys.path.append('/path/to/another/directory')
   ```
4. Try importing a module from this new directory after adding it to the path.

### Step 4: Run the Script
1. Run the **`main.py`** script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Observe how Python searches for modules. What happens if the modules are not in the current working directory?

### Step 5: Analyze the Behavior
- What does `sys.path` represent?
- How does Python find modules and packages during imports?
- What happens when you modify the `sys.path` to include a new directory?

## Searching for Modules and Packages in Python

When you import a module or package in Python, the interpreter looks for the module in the directories listed in `sys.path`. The `sys.path` is a list of strings that specifies the search paths for modules. By default, it includes the current working directory, the standard library directories, and site-packages.

### Key Features:
- **Current Working Directory**: Python first searches for modules in the current working directory.
- **Standard Library**: If the module isn't found, Python checks its standard library.
- **Site-packages**: Finally, Python checks the `site-packages` directory, where third-party modules are installed.
- **Custom Paths**: You can modify the `sys.path` to include custom directories, allowing Python to search for modules in new locations.

### Example:
In this challenge, you will observe how Python searches for modules in `my_search_package` and how you can modify the search behavior using `sys.path`.
